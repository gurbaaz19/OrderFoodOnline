# TABLEORDERAPP
DevSoc Hackathon

## Motivation
```
During COVID-19 it is important for restaurants to adopt newer methods of 
taking orders replacing the old methods of a human taking the order . This
application would act as a bridge between the customers on the tables and the
kitchen. The order can be placed here and the information would be relayed to 
the kitchen for them to prepare the food and provide the customer with the food
during the estimated time.(Backend yet to be implemented)
```
## Working
```
After opening the app, select the items you want to order by clicking the add
button, to have more quantitiy of the same item click the button multiple
times. You can view the quantity of items ordered in the carts menu along
with the net payable amount. You can choose to reset the order, or confirm
it by choosing the appropriate option.
```
